     Specializing in Auriculotherapy, an ancient oriental system which has been in use for close to 3000 years to treat a variety of medical 
     conditions. By normalizing the stimulation of the electrical conductivity that is generated in the brain and directed to every part of the 
     human body, Auriculotherapy enables the body as a whole to perform at its optimum. This stimulation is achieved with the help of very small 
     magnetized stainless steel beads that are applied in very specific areas of the external part of the ear. He has been in practice applying Auriculotherapy techniques and procedures since 1991.

The purpose of acupuncture is to prevent or modify the perception of pain and is thus a form of pain control.
