  comment: "They came out trimmed, pruned and removed all ball moss and a big branch
    that we needed to clear from an Oak tree to make room for building a shed in the
    corner area of the lot. They were accurate and worked very fast and even raked
    every twig that fell as they trimmed.  It was such a relieve to have a reliable
    tree company handle everything that needed to be done in about 3 hours of hard
    work. Thanks a lot guys for a great job!\r\n"
