      We are extremely satisfied with the work George Potter and his company, Heartwood Tree Service and Solutions, completed at our address over the last two years.
      Not only does the work meet expected, prescribed standards of a certified arborist, it exceeds them. Mr Potter remains on site with his crew, ensuring adherence to those standards in a professional manner, and  is available to answer questions and offer advice.  He noted that some of our trees were being over-watered by our new system and met with the sprinkler representative to suggest a solution.  The solution resulted in improvement to our trees.
      We feel that one, favorite, tree was saved  by this intervention.
      
      Cleanup procedures were thorough and impressive.  

      We commend and recommend this company to any possible clients seeking such service. Their ethical, expert approach to tree care is unmatched by those we have used in the past.

      We hired Heartwood Tree Service, George Potter and crew to remove an old Hackberry that was splitting in the backyard. 
      The tree had a bad fungus and was leaning towards the neighbors house. We had already cut some of our fence to accommodate the leaning of the tree. 
      The crew did a great job. It was a great feeling to get everything done with no stress and problems. 
      Heartwood is definitely in my top recommendations for tree service in San Antonio. Thanks George!

       I had George Potter here today with his men and they did a perfectly lovely job on our trees. My idea of a GOOD pruning is to not notice that the tree looks so different. It appears calm and full and NATURAL! And they certainly did that. Such good work, good attitude and wanting to please! Wow. Don't find that much any more. Will sing their praises to anyone who can say: "Tree".

       I just want to take a moment to rave about George at Heartwood Tree Services. We needed some work done and called Heartwood. He showed up early and ready to tackle EVERY issue and concern we had. Not only is George very knowledgeable but his work ethic is second to NONE! We had so many questions and he answered every one, giving his expert guidance while continuing to work. I recommend them to everyone and anyone who needs an expert arborist. Thank you George & Heartwood for your excellent service and professionalism!

       I have long been a fan of George Potter! Not only because he is a longtime friend, but he is the most reliable source for advice when it comes to trees and landscaping. See, I have the gift of a 'brown' thumb and an intense fear of heights. Therefore, I trust George and his crew to handle what I can't. 
       I mean, sure you can pick anyone to come to your home and handle the chore of trimming trees, caring for them after the fact, etc. 
       Just know who you are inviting to come to your home. You see, I am a single mother of 2 young children and I must have faith in whomever I call on for help. 
       Not only do I need to trust them, but I need to be sure they won't do 2 things. They won't waste my time and they won't waste my money. 
       Bottom line, I use Heartwood Tree Services and feel you will be missing out if you don't.

       After recently moving into our new home, we immediately were excited to work on our front yard for our new "pride and joy". A beautiful oak tree that had obviously been neglected in maintenance, but still a very strong and healthy tree was the focal point of our front yard. We are on a corner lot, so our yard is highly visible. We wanted to show it off and still stay within budget. We called George Potter with Heart Wood Tree and the results were incredible. We get compliments on the way that just taking care of few things has really improved the appearance of our yard - especially that GORGEOUS tree! We are thrilled with the outcome and cannot wait to start on our back yard! We will proudly refer Heart Wood Tree any day of the week and twice on Sundays!! Thank you so much!

       After using several tree trimmers that actually did not know what they were doing, Mr. Potter is the only person that I trust with my trees. He's an experienced arborist with much knowledge on how save unhealthy trees and uses skilled techniques on how to maintain thriving ones. He also has a detailed eye to make the trees look beautiful and pruned. I am glad I've used Heartwood Trees in the past and will continue to use their services.

       George, I wanted to drop you a note and let you know that we absolutely love the work that you and your crew did for us! Our trees look like they belong in a state park now. It makes the curb appeal of our home look so much better. We appreciate your promptness in returning our initial call and coming out to give us an estimate right away. Thanks for taking the time to tell us about the different types of trees we had and pointing out the ones that needed some extra fertilizer care. You and your guys did an awesome job with the oaks and the removal of that large cedar tree by the pool. I came home from work and everything was cleaned up and gone. Looks great! Thanks for leaving the nice stack of firewood me - that will save me a few bucks the next time we go camping. If I know of anyone that is looking to save some tree trimming done I will definitely pass your information to them!

       George, we were very pleased with your company's professionalism and the employee's outstanding work ethic. Your attention to detail was very much appreciated. I couldn't have asked for more value for the cost of the job. Also, thanks for the great clean-up...no work for me!
