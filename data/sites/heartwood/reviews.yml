  comment: "George and his team did a marvelous job. We have several large oak trees
    in our front and back yard. We are so pleased with the work. I was also quite
    impressed with the clean up. We had several trees around our pool which he neatly
    trimmed and left our pool without leaves and branches. George and his team were
    able to trim just enough to allow us extra sunlight around the pool ( which helped
    warm it up) but still had enough shade if we did not want to sit in the sun. The
    trees all look so pretty now! I would highly recommend!\r\n\r\nD.L.S."

  comment: "George Potter and the Heartwoods team tackled a yard full of trees that
    weren't trimmed in the last 10-15 years. Over the course of two full days, our
    property was completely transformed, and the trees look healthier and more beautiful
    than ever before. George and his team are courteous and professional, and I would
    unhesitatingly recommend them to other homeowners.\r\n\r\nP.R. \r\nSan Antonio,

  comment: "I met with 5 tree trimmers to get estimates.  They generally agreed with
    the work that needed to be done.  Remove a large splintered limb and trim a lot
    of deadwood from\r\ntwo never trimmed 25 year old Ash trees, and provide roofline
    clearance.  George and 3 crew showed up right on time and everybody worked until
    they were through.\r\nNo sidewalk supervisors here. They even raked the yard when
    they were done.  Now I have two happy trees. George is a friendly guy. What else
    do you need to know?\r\nOh yeah his bill was exactly what his estimate was ...
    less than half of what one of the  other arborist' wanted. Call George Potter.\r\n\r\nRW\r\nSan

  comment: " We are extremely satisfied with the work George Potter and his company,
    Heartwood Tree Service and Solutions, completed at our address over the last two
    years. Not only does the work meet expected, prescribed standards of a certified
    arborist, it exceeds them. Mr Potter remains on site with his crew, ensuring adherence
    to those standards in a professional manner, and is available to answer questions
    and offer advice. He noted that some of our trees were being over-watered by our
    new system and met with the sprinkler representative to suggest a solution. The
    solution resulted in improvement to our trees. We feel that one, favorite, tree
    was saved by this intervention. Cleanup procedures were thorough and impressive.
    We commend and recommend this company to any possible clients seeking such service.
    Their ethical, expert approach to tree care is unmatched by those we have used
    in the past.\r\n"

  comment: 'HELLO I had George Potter here today with his men and they did a perfectly
    lovely job on our trees. My idea of a GOOD pruning is to not notice that the tree
    looks so different. It appears calm and full and NATURAL! And they certainly did
    that. Such good work, good attitude and wanting to please! Wow. Don''t find that
    much any more. Will sing their praises to anyone who can say: "Tree".'
