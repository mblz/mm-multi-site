- :comment: 'I had George Potter here today with his men and they did a perfectly
    lovely job on our trees. My idea of a GOOD pruning is to not notice that the tree
    looks so different. It appears calm and full and NATURAL! And they certainly did
    that. Such good work, good attitude and wanting to please! Wow. Don''t find that
    much any more. Will sing their praises to anyone who can say: "Tree".'
