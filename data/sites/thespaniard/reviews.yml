  comment: Fernando did a great job on my property.  I had numerous oak trees to trim
    and he did a great job trimming them.  All cuts were properly dressed and all
    limbs were cleaned up.  His crew was meticulous in ensuring  our property was
    clean from any tree debris.  I would recommend Fernando and his team to anyone.
