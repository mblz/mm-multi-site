  comment: "Fernando and his crew were fantastic!  He promptly arrived at the designated
    time and was gracious enough to save several of my flowering ground cover by digging
    up the roots before starting to grind the stump.\r\n\r\nKH\r\nSan Antonio,Tx"

  comment: Fernando did a great job on my property.  I had numerous oak trees to trim
    and he did a great job trimming them.  All cuts were properly dressed and all
    limbs were cleaned up.  His crew was meticulous in ensuring  our property was
    clean from any tree debris.  I would recommend Fernando and his team to anyone.
