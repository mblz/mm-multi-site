       My husband, Kerry Mabry, and myself, Sandy Mabry, have been patients of Dr. Aaron Goldberg for several months. 
       This has been the best thing that my husband and I have ever done for our health. I have lost this far 44 lbs. and my husband 48, and we are 
       still loosing. Kerry and I have changed the way we cook and eat. We have more energy and we feel much better than before.
       <p> Dr. Goldberg has also helped me control pain in my knees and hips. 
       I also suffer from Type 2 Diabetes, and since I started this program my sugar has dropped down to normal levels. 
       My physician told me that he would take me off the pills that I take for Diabetes, because I don't need them anymore. 
       Kerry has also experienced his high blood pressure coming down to normal readings.

        <b>Thank you. </b>
        <p>That is the first thing I would like to say. Having the opportunity to experience 'single digit' clothing for the first time in my life 
        is difficult to express. I have been a size 22. I have been a size 12. Never a size 8. 
        Now I have worn a size 6. Certain types of clothes, of course, but nonetheless a size 6. 
        I could not have done it without the help of Dr. Goldberg. His constant encouragement and consistent help has helped me get 
        closer and closer to finding the real me. At 39 years of age, one would think I would have found myself by now, 
        but with a renewed confidence and healthy life style, I'm having fun. I recommend this program to who, like me, 
        doesn't know what it is like to experience 'single digit' clothing.
        <p/> Thank you Dr. Goldberg

        I first heard about Dr. Goldberg when a friend on the program successfully dropped more than 30 lbs. 
        She described the basics of the plan and I decided to try it myself. By age 40, I'd been on the diet 'merry-go-round' most of my life -
        especially struggling to maintain my weight during my mid 20s . . . I was always active and played competitive sports till I graduated from - 
        it was great because I could eat like a horse and still maintain a healthy weight because of the strenuous physical activity associated with 
        athletics. After graduation, however, I started working fulltime and noticed a gradual but steady weight gain because I hadn't changed my eating 
        habits and wasn't nearly as physically active as I'd been in years past.
        <p>Over the next 20 years or so, I tried Nutri-System, Cabbage Soup, The Zone, and a couple of other popular diet programs, including 
        injections from a physician who specialized in weight loss. I had some success, but had difficulty staying with them because the programs are 
        too boring, they got too expensive, and the packed foods didn't taste good. My will power exhausted and the stress of job-related pressures 
        got the best of me - eventually I ballooned to 200 lbs ... I was miserable - physically and emotionally.
        <p>I contacted Dr. Goldberg and he explained the basics of the program and how a balance of proper diet and Auriculotherapy stimulation 
        would help me lose weight safely - without pills, injections, and without starving myself or having to buy pre-packed foods. 
        I began the program in the spring and lost 50 lbs. over several months ...  I felt great and looked better than I had in years. 
        Dr. Goldberg encourages patients to focus on overall reduction of inches - not just weight loss ... and he's absolutely right. 
        Seeing the weight loss on the scale is great, but looking and feeling good in your clothes again is also important 
        (and equally motivating when you don't have to struggle with the zipper on those too- tight jeans)! Dr. Goldberg's kind and gentle 
        manner is also very appealing ... he doesn't judge or chastise patients when they're not meeting their goals -
        he makes it clear from the beginning that your success depends on YOU and how diligently you adhere to the program ... he's always willing to 
        answer questions and provide insight as to how you can achieve optimum results on the program.
        <p> Many thanks to Dr. Goldberg,

        Seventeen weeks ago, I embarked upon a weight loss program with Dr. Aaron Goldberg, D.D.S.. Dr. Goldberg specializes in an all-natural alternative 
        to control weight, pain, migraines and general health. When I began the program with Dr. Goldberg, I weighed 200 pound. 
        I had very little energy and was beginning to think that old age was catching up with me. I am 61 years old.
        <p>One of my colleagues at Clark High School, where I work as a counselor, told me about the program with Dr. Goldberg. Although I was somewhat skeptical at first, I decided to try the program. Almost immediately after beginning the program I had a different energy level ... I began losing weight immediately. Through 17 weeks, I have lost 39 pounds and now weight 161 pounds. The most amazing thing about his entire experience is not the fact that I have lost so much weight; it is the fact that I have a high energy level all day long. I do not become tired after I eat, and I have more energy to the things I love to do...This program has taught me to change my life style permanently. I went from size 36 waist to a size 31. 
        I now wear small swimming trunks I had not worn since I was a teenage ... at the age of 61; I feel that I finally gained control over my own body.

        Auriculotherapy has been the answer to my weight loss. I have lost 45 pounds since I started the program. I have tried various diets including: cabbage soup diet, Atkins diet, Weight Watchers, etc. but have not been successful with any of these programs. As a result of losing the weight with this program, my health has improved.
        I have Lupus concentrated in my liver. I am diabetic and was on medication. I have ITP which is a low Platelet count. Since I've been on this program, I am no longer on diabetes medication, do not suffer from plantar faciatis and my Lupus is in remission.
        All my medical evaluations have indicated that I am in very good health. I feel good about my weight loss and my health.
        I feel that the reason for my good health is losing the weight in such a health manner with the help of Auriculotherapy. 
        I am very grateful to a friend for referring me to Dr. Goldberg.
