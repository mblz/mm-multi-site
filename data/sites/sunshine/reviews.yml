  comment: "I wanted to share that we had a great experience with Raymond and his
    crew. From my first contact with Raymond to the start of the project was 2 weeks.
    \ Total project took 2 weeks.  Sunshine picked up the pieces, after we had disappointing
    results from our previous landscaping company.  Sunshine added many plants, cleaned
    my trees,  tweaked our irrigation to run better, built an amazing retaining wall
    and really enhanced our property.  We live on a corner lot and Raymond brought
    it to life!  He was generous with his ideas, very hard working, honest and passionate
    about his business!  He was hands-on everyday and brought his crew lunch regularly.
    \ I appreciate people who are honest and who have integrity.  They worked without
    delays or excuses, worked a full day 6 days a week and staying within our budget!
    \ Thank you, Raymond for making our home more beautiful than I could have imagined!
    \ You are a blessing and very good at what you do!\r\n\r\nWK\r\nSan Antonio"
