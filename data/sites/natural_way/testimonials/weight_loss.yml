     My husband, Kerry Mabry, and myself, Sandy Mabry, have been patients of Dr. Aaron Goldberg for several months. This has been the best thing that my husband and I have ever done for our health. I have lost this far 44 lbs. and my husband 48, and we are still loosing. Kerry and I have changed the way we cook and eat. We have more energy and we feel much better than before.
     <p> Dr. Goldberg has also helped me control pain in my knees and hips. I also suffer from Type 2 Diabetes, and since I started this program my sugar has dropped down to normal levels. My physician told me that he would take me off the pills that I take for Diabetes, because I don’t need them anymore. Kerry has also experienced his high blood pressure coming down to normal readings.

        <b>Thank you. </b>
        <p>That is the first thing I would like to say. Having the opportunity to experience “single digit” clothing for the first time in my life 
        is difficult to express. I have been a size 22. I have been a size 12. Never a size 8. 
        Now I have worn a size 6. Certain types of clothes, of course, but nonetheless a size 6. 
        I could not have done it without the help of Dr. Goldberg. His constant encouragement and consistent help has helped me get 
        closer and closer to finding the real me. At 39 years of age, one would think I would have found myself by now, 
        but with a renewed confidence and healthy life style, I’m having fun. I recommend this program to who, like me, 
        doesn’t know what it is like to experience “single digit clothing.
        <p/> Thank you Dr. Goldberg
