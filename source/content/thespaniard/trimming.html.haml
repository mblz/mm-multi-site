  Tree Trimming
  %small  Services in Texas

%p
  In our Texas hill country, the value of keeping our trees beautiful and healthy is the process of keeping them trimmed to avoid overgrown or weak  limbs and branches, and the spread of ball moss.  Pruning all dead limbs brings any type of tree to health and stability.   


%p
  Oaks are more sensitive to diseases so the process of painting the wounds anytime a cut is done is very important.  Tree hacking in San Antonio and surrounding areas have spread the ball moss and fungus diseases thus making the trees weak and vulnerable to fall during winter season or during a storm.

%h3 Why Trim Trees

%p
  Mature trees need to be trimmed to keep them healthy and alive for years to come. Trees that are old are more susceptible to have branches and limbs break.  Young trees need to be trimmed for growth.  They  need to establish good branch structure and stable framework. Pruning will help to guide the tree to naturally establish a solid central truck and sturdy branches.   

%p
  In mature or medium size trees, we raise the crown or reshape the  tree canopy when the branches are low and pose a problem to traffic or if the tree is too close to the highway or if it poses a safety hazard for pedestrians.  



%p 
  If you have old trees or low-hanging limbs, don't wait until bad weather hits.  Especially if the tree is close to a structure, which will definitely fall and cause thousands of structural damage.  Use caution when trying to move any fallen branches or limbs.  Call your insurance immediately and take pictures of the damage.

  Time to Prune Oaks
 
%p
  During the winter from mid to late winter (January through March),  is a great time to perform tree care for Oaks.  We will trim the limbs or branch  that will prevent tree growth and prune the area to let light for growth.  We will canopy the trees keeping the most dominant branches and limbs.

    Because Oaks are the most dominant trees in San Antonio and surrounding areas, we concentrate in explaining more of their process but we also specialize in trimming elms trees, mesquite trees, ash trees, bald cypress, fruit trees such as pecan and much more.  Each tree requires different space, trimming, canopy styles, water and nutrients to expand its yearly growth.  Semi yearly tree maintenance will keep your trees healthy and your tree budget expense down.
