  A European facial is designed to detoxify and revitalize your skin. It exfoliates and nourishes the skin to promote beautiful, well-hydrated skin. It is a form of deep cleaning into the pores of your face. Exfoliation happens while a steam vapor is directed at your face and your eyes are covered lightly with a strip of cotton. At your request, extraction of blackheads or whiteheads can also be done at the time of the facial.
