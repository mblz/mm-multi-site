      Tree Trimming
    
    %p
      In San Antonio and the Hill Country, having your trees trimmed properly is critical to avoid limbs and branches from breaking and falling into your property.  Tree maintenance should be done regularly by skilled professionals to avoid unhealthy tree structure and growth. Always hire a professional to avoid injury or damage to yourself or your property. We trim, cut and prune: Mesquite, Oak, Hackberry, Elms, Mulberry and some types of shrubs and bushes that need cleaning. 
      Approximately 75% of our jobs are general trimming and pruning; however, yearly maintenance should extend to cabling and bolting for fallen or leaning trees and diagnosing sick trees. My staff is trained and experienced and we are proud to be helping our community to keep our environment clean.
