      %p

        In San Antonio and the Hill Country, having your trees trimmed properly during winter seasons is just as critical as in summer. During cold season, limbs and branches break easier and unhealthy trees are more susceptible of falling into your premises. You can still request to trim and prune all trees up until January (except spring blooming trees) and start to plant new trees from November to March. Our crew maintains approximately anywhere from five to twenty Texas trees daily depending on tree size, job size and weather. We trim, cut and prune Mesquite trees, Oak Trees, Hackberry Trees, Elms to their beautiful healthy stage; paint and seal all wounds on Oaks to prevent

        from spreading. I personally evaluate each tree and walk the property with property owners to determine the scoop of work, tree issues and job deadlines. Approximately 75% of our jobs are tree trimming and pruning; however, yearly maintenance extends to cabling and bolting fallen or leaning trees and diagnosing sick trees. Heartwood Tree Company provides tree trimming for areas in: San Antonio, Boerne, Helotes, Comfort, Hondo, Bandera, Devine and other surrounding metro cities.

        %li 
          Trimming keeps critters from making homes in your precious trees or using the trees that are close to the roof as stairways into your home attics especially in woody areas like Helotes and Bandera Texas. 
        %li 
          Attic installation, repainting, siding repairs, electrical wiring repairs can add up to thousands of dollars in damages and repairs when this happens.

          As tree lovers, our goal is to save the tree and your structure without hurting any of our free roaming animals. The risk of these critters returning are high especially in winter because they are looking for a warm place to hide or to raise their babies. The solution is lifting the canopy and clearing the roofline to avoid easy access.
