      %b Heartwood Tree Service 
      provides the highest quality tree trimming, tree removals, tree diagnose and tree preservation treatments in San Antonio, Boerne, and Schertz, Texas. 
    %p George Potter, owner, works daily with crews to protect and preserve our South Texas trees to make them healthy and happy. We at Heartwood have earned a 5 star customer service satisfaction rating because of our attention to detail. We sanitize our equipment everyday before we begin each project as to not spread disease from one tree to the other. We spray all wounds on Oaks when finished. Oak wilt is a serious issue here in our area and itâ€™s imperative that we take all precautions necessary to prevent spread of fungus that could comprise our communities.
