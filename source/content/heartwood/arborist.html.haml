    It's my responsibility and privilege as a certified arborist and environmentalist to help protect and preserve one of our Great Earth's most precious and vital natural resources, 
    %b 'Our Trees'. 

    I have dedicated my time to learn the skills to provide the best tree care for all our clients.
    A Healthy Tree is a Happy Tree and far less susceptible to diseases and pathogens when properly cared for.

    What separates me from my competition is that I work with my crew everyday to accomplish proper pruning and trimming techniques. There is always a certified arborist working on every project (me) because I don't feel comfortable just dropping 4 guys off and hoping the job turns out right. I am at every job to supervise that every cut is made properly, every wound is properly sealed and everything is done in the highest standard set by (ANSI) and the (ISA). We sanitize all of our equipment before every project, clean up and haul off all debris.
